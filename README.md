# Emotion-Detection-From-Tweets-Using-Bert-and-SVM
A BERT and SVM approach for the task of emotion detection. A novel BERT-SVM ensemble model for the task of emotion detection is introduce.

Firstly the SVM model must be train in order to be used when building the ensemble model. 
All the code for the BERT model and Ensemble model is found in Bert.ipynb file. The SVM model must be imported there using the pickle library.
For building the ensemble model is recommended for the BERTweet version of BERT to be used.
